### Adaptive_Cruise_Control
##Objective: The goal of the project was to design a circuit and PCB for implementing cruise control in an electric vehicle. The circuit design involves using an Arduino microcontroller to process data from an ultrasonic sensor, a slide switch to trigger cruise mode and a DIP Switch SPST x4 to switch the cruising speed. The system is intended to maintain a constant speed of the vehicle without requiring continuous input from the driver.
